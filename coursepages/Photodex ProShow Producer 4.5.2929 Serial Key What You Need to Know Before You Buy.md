If you have purchased Photodex ProShow Producer 4.5.2929, you will need a serial key to activate it and unlock its full features. A serial key is a unique code that identifies your license and verifies your purchase. You can find your serial key in the confirmation email that you received from Photodex after buying the software.
 
However, if you have lost your serial key or you are using a trial version of Photodex ProShow Producer 4.5.2929, you may encounter some problems when trying to activate it. You may see a message that says "Activation Server is Unavailable" or "Evaluation Copy" or "Use Illegally". This means that the software cannot connect to Photodex's server to validate your serial key or that your serial key is invalid or expired.
 
In this article, we will show you how to solve these issues and activate Photodex ProShow Producer 4.5.2929 with a serial key.
 
## Method 1: Replace three .dnt files
 
This method will bypass the serial key requirement by replacing three .dnt files in the ProShow installation directory. These files are responsible for checking the license status of the software. By replacing them with modified versions, you can trick the software into thinking that it is already activated.
 
To use this method, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the ProShow installation directory, which is usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Photodex\Proshow Producer.
2. Rename the all.dnt file to all2.dnt.
3. Rename the if.dnt file to if2.dnt.
4. Rename the pshow.dnt file to pshow2.dnt.
5. Download the three .dnt files from this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jl0w7y6fZ3wF0yq3Q8c8XZzYRQbO7XgE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jl0w7y6fZ3wF0yq3Q8c8XZzYRQbO7XgE/view?usp=sharing).
6. Copy the three .dnt files from the zip file into the same directory where you renamed the original files.
7. Run ProShow and enjoy its full features.

## Method 2: Delete proshow.cfg and proshow.phd files
 
This method will remove the banners that display "Evaluation Copy" or "Use Illegally" on your slideshows and videos. These banners are caused by two files in the ProShow installation directory: proshow.cfg and proshow.phd. These files store some configuration and preference settings for the software. By deleting them, you can reset these settings and get rid of the banners.
